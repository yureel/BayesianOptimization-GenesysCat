# BayesianOptimization-GenesysCat
This repository provides additional background on the Bayesian optimization algorithm implemented in the microkinetic model generator "Genesys-Cat". The Bayesian optimization code is especially developed to efficiently identify optimal kinetic parameters for complex catalytic reaction networks. More information regarding the detailed Bayesian optimization algorithm can be found in the publication. Note that the Bayesian optimization algorithm here is demonstrated on the Rosenbrock function. As the algorithm is specifically tuned for catalytic reactions it can perform suboptimally for the Rosenbrock function.

# Microkinetic Models Catalytic Cracking
Additionally four Chemkin input files are present which model the catalytic cracking of iso-octane across three different faujasite zeolites (CBV760, CBV720, LZY20). The gas-phase Chemkin file is the same for all zeolites.
